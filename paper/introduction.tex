\section{Introduction}
Regular expression (regex) matching is a well-studied problem in computer science -- in this work we present Reef, a regex compiler
and matcher that produces zero-knowledge certificates of matching, while hiding the target document. Consider this scenario --
a patient wants to prove they have a genetic predispotion which makes them suitable for a new drug trial. But for obvious privacy reasons
they do not which to disclose their genome to the pharmaceutical company running the trial. Instead, they create a cryptographic commitment to their genome, much like a hash,
as well as a zkSNARK that confirs either a positive match or negative match. Then the pharmaceutical is able to confirm if the patient is a match without leaking
any additional information, in fact a whole bunch of patterns can be encoded as a regex and checked in zero-knowledge.

Our construction Reef gives optimal constraint sizes for both positive matches and negative matches, here is how it works.
